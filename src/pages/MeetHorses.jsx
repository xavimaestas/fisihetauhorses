                <h4>Stan</h4>
                <p>
                    Handsome and kind... Stanley is a papered American Quarter Horse standing at 16 hands tall. He doubles as a therapy horse in an instance. ðŸ˜‰ Stanley is without a doubt Sam's kindred spirit. He was sired in Farmington, Utah in 2011.

            <h4>Sunshine</h4>
            <p>
                The boss, smart and swift. Sunshineâ€™s striking blue and brown eyes fit her personality perfectly. Her fierce disposition make her serious competition as the boss in any herd. However, donâ€™t let her fool you, sheâ€™s just playing hard to get. ðŸ˜‰ Sunshine is a papered American Paint Horse and stands at 16.1 hands tall. She was sired in Lehi, Utah in 2012. Sunshine is certainly Samâ€™s ride or die.

                <h4> Nocona</h4>
                <p>
                    Gentle Nebraska boy, sold to the Lone Star state, finally settling in the Rocky Mountains. His strides are smooth, like a one-ton pickup loaded down. Nocona is a papered American Quarter Horse standing at an astounding 16.2 hands high. Nocona's awareness and patience with children is remarkable (available for babysitting). ðŸ˜‰ He was sired in Butler County Nebraska in 2012.
